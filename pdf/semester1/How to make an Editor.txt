Write a program that prints a string to the console, test.
Expand it to write that string to a file also, test.
Expand it to read the string from another file, test.
Decide if you want to try to make it a line-based editor or a notepad-like editor, (assuming line-based) expand it to print out only the line you choose, test.
Divide the string storage variable into a line separated buffer, change your file read and write functions to handle read and write by line to the buffer, test.
Write a command parser to read what to do from console, like load to call your read file function, [code]print (n)[/code] to call the print to console function, save to call the write file function, and you might need quit to exit when you are done, test.
Expand the print to console function with a function to print a range (perhaps using a function supporting a callback so you can reuse it for other functions), perhaps using a for-loop? Change the command parser to support ranges, test.
